# ‚ù§Ô∏è Heart Stroke Risk Prediction

This project is a **machine learning-powered web app** that predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on user-provided health parameters.  
It uses a **Logistic Regression** model trained on cardiovascular data, selected after evaluating multiple supervised classification algorithms.

## üìã Features

- User-friendly **Streamlit** web interface
- Accepts health parameters like age, cholesterol, blood pressure, heart rate, etc.
- Uses the same preprocessing pipeline from training (scaler + expected columns)
- Real-time prediction with a clear **High Risk / Low Risk** output message

## üìä Model Selection

We tested the following supervised classification algorithms:

1. Logistic Regression ‚úÖ _(best performer)_
2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
4. Decision Tree
5. Naive Bayes

Logistic Regression was chosen based on the best performance in terms of **accuracy** and **f1_score**.
